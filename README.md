### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Roman!

I'm a leader in tech, currently **Head of Data Science in AirAsia** working on experimentation and blockchain technologies. Prior to AirAsia, I was working as a Principal Engineer in Grab, the super app of South East Asia where we built Product Insights & Experimentation Platform amongst other things. I also obtained a PhD in Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction with Trinity College Dublin & IBM Research, and worked as an engineer at various successful companies in Europe, building things like online gaming platforms, autonomous helicopters, or particle/matter collision simulators!

### Distributed Systems
> Distributed systems I have designed and open-sourced

* [emitter-io/emitter](https://github.com/emitter-io/emitter) - high performance, distributed and low latency publish-subscribe platform
* [kelindar/talaria](https://github.com/kelindar/talaria) - distributed, highly available, and low latency time-series database for Presto
