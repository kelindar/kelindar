### Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Roman!

I've spent my career building systems that scale â€” sometimes even as planned. At Careem (Uber Inc.), I led the architecture for Data & AI, building platforms for machine learning, experimentation, and event processing that supported operations at scale. Before that, I served as Head of Data Science at AirAsia, where I worked to make data-driven decisions more accessible across the organization. At Grab, Southeast Asia's superapp, I worked on experimentation platforms and was the architect for transport and driver experience, helping millions of rides happen more efficiently. My Ph.D. from Trinity College Dublin & IBM Research focused on debugging parallel systems and visualizing performance problems â€” a mix of computer science and psychology that taught me patience (and the limits of it). Earlier in my career, I worked on everything from autonomous helicopters to particle simulators, building systems that were occasionally more reliable than their creators.
